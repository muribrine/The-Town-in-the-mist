# The-Town-in-the-mist
a turn-based horror game played on the browser.
 
## The performace of Javascript and the discontinuation of the project ##

From the beginning of the project I always knew that performace was going to be a big problem, but while implementing the A* algorithm it became clear that making this game in Javascript would be impossible, 2GBs of RAM was being needed and the project was barely getting started.
Also, the project was initially planned to have 3D details, like a tree with dots to represent its trunk or stacked lines to make a wall, but for performance reasons this idea had to be dropped as well.

## The future of the "The town in the mist" project ##

The implementation of the project in Javascript will continue to be available in this Github repository but the project will continue in Go in a new repo.
